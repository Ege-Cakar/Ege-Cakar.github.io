I love reading, music, taking walks, spending time with friends and family, cooking, and strategy games. 

My favorite book of all time is probably *Pachinko* by Min Jin Lee, which I recommend everyone read. If into philosophy, I recommend you look into reading Seneca and Aurelius. 

I listen to music so much that my ears get tired. Avid fan of Jazz(Chet Baker, Stan Getz, Miles Davis, Frank Sinatra, Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, Masayoshi Takanaka), Rock(Pink Floyd, Muse, The Strokes, Franz Ferdinand), Spanish/Latin Folk(Compay Segundo, Mon Laferte), Metal(Gojira), Blues(Albert King, Freddie King, B.B King), Other Folk(Fish in a Birdcage, Poor Man's Poison), Funk(Daft Punk)... and many more artists that I missed. If it's representable in audio form I probably listen to it. I'm also Turkish, so if you want to give Turkish music a try, I recommend Cem Karaca.
