I'm a second year undergraduate at [Harvard College](https://www.harvard.edu/) double concentrating (majoring) in Statistics and Physics, with a secondary (minor) in Philosophy. I'm really glad you took the time to visit the website! I'm interested in machine learning broadly â€” my current area of interest is mathematical and semantic reasoning. I am a member of the [Pehlevan Lab](https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/) as an undergraduate researcher and have been with them since Summer of 2023. Other than machine learning, I'm interested in the vast majority of Physics (even solid state), with a particular interest in Quantum Information Theory. I hope you have a wonderful day and the website helps you get to know me better!
